<p><strong>Goal and objectives of the products</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stock management</strong>   is done on the spreadsheet which is vulnerable to costly human error. 
Express kitchen web application  aims to provide an efficient and accurate way to monitor and track stock at AkiraChix to avoid over budgeting. 
By adding stock to the system you are able to take control of the stock level in that you can add, delete and update the products and it automatically generates items to re-order. 
The system also consists of a menu that points to the stock and a dashboard that allows the user to view what they are allowed to depending on the permission in that the cook can only view the menu and update and edit the stock while the Chef has all the permission to view, update/edit and delete the stock, orders, and menu. 
This product’s aim is to track and monitor stock to prevent over budgeting.</p>
